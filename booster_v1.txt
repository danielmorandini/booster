booster version 1 - protocol specification

1. Introduction
1.1 The packet notation

Booster communicaton relies on TCP. The packets follow a specific format that
will be explained in detail in the following sections. Unless otherwise noted,
the decimal numbers appearing in packet-format diagrams represent the length
of the corresponding field, in octets.  Where a given octet must take on a
specific value, the syntax X'hh' is used to denote the value of the single 
octet in that field. When the word 'Variable' is used, it indicates that the
corresponding field has a variable length defined either by an associated 
(one or two octet) length field, or by a data type field.


2. Procedure

3. Requests
There are two kind of requests that a booster node expects. The ones coming
from an external entity and the ones sent by another booster node. From now
on they will be called respectively external and internal requests.

In this section we will cover the former ones.

3.1 External requests
3.1.1 Connect

This request is used to make a booster node be aware and connect to another
one.

        |VER | CMD |  RSV  | ATYP | BST.ADDR | BST.PORT |
        +----+-----+-------+------+----------+----------+
        | 1  |  1  | X'00' |  1   | Variable |    2     |
        +----+-----+-------+------+----------+----------+

     Where:

          o  VER    protocol version: X'01'
          o  CMD    command CONNECT: X'01'
          o  RSV    RESERVED
          o  ATYP   address type of following address
             o  IP V4 address: X'01'
             o  DOMAINNAME: X'03'
             o  IP V6 address: X'04'
          o  BST.ADDR       remote booster address
          o  BST.PORT       remote booster node
